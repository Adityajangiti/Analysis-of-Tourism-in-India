							<h2>LUGGAGE TO CARRY</h2>
							<p>If you are planning to visit Agra, here are some luggage items you may want to consider packing:</p>
							<li><b>Clothing</b> - Pack clothes that are suitable for the weather. Agra experiences hot and dry summers, so light and breathable clothes are recommended. In winter, temperatures can drop, so it's a good idea to pack some warmer clothes as well.</li>
							<li><b>Footwear</b> - Pack comfortable walking shoes as there are many tourist places in Agra that require walking. Flip flops or sandals are also a good idea for hot weather.</li>
							<li><b>Sun protection</b> - Pack sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat to protect yourself from the sun during the day.</li>
							<li><b>Insect repellent</b> - Agra is known for mosquitoes, so it's a good idea to pack insect repellent to protect yourself from mosquito bites.</li>
							<li><b>Medications</b> -  If you take any prescription medication, make sure to bring enough for your entire trip. It's also a good idea to bring some basic over-the-counter medications like pain relievers, antacids, and anti-diarrheal medication.</li>
							<li><b>Power bank and charger</b> - Carry a portable charger and the necessary chargers for your electronics as you may need them during your trip.</li>
							<li><b>Travel adapter</b> - India uses type D and type C power plugs, so if you are traveling from a country that uses a different type of plug, you will need a travel adapter.</li>
							<li><b>Backpack or daypack</b> - A small backpack or daypack can be useful for carrying essential items like water, snacks, and a camera while exploring the city.</li>
							<li><b>Money and documents</b> - Make sure to carry enough cash or a credit/debit card, and keep your important documents like passport, visa, and ID card safe.</li>
