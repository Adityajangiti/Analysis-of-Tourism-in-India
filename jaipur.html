							<h2>LUGGAGE TO CARRY</h2>
							<p>If you are planning a trip to Jaipur, here are some luggage items you may want to consider packing:</p>
							<li><b>Clothing</b> - Jaipur has a hot and dry climate for most of the year, so it's recommended to pack light and comfortable clothes. Cotton t-shirts, shorts, and skirts are suitable for the daytime, and light jackets or sweaters may be needed for the evenings.</li>
							<li><b>Footwear</b> -  Comfortable walking shoes or sneakers are recommended for exploring the many historical sites in Jaipur. Sandals or flip-flops are also good options for the hot weather.</li>
							<li><b>Swimwear</b> -   Don't forget to pack swimwear if you plan on taking a dip in the beautiful beaches of Andaman and Nicobar.</li>
							<li><b>Sun protection</b> - Pack sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat to protect yourself from the sun during the day.</li>
							<li><b>Insect repellent</b> - Mosquitoes and other insects can be a nuisance, especially during the evenings, so it's recommended to pack insect repellent.</li>
							<li><b>Medications</b> -  If you take any prescription medication, make sure to bring enough for your entire trip. It's also a good idea to bring some basic over-the-counter medications like pain relievers, antacids, and anti-diarrheal medication.</li>
							<li><b>Power bank and charger</b> - Carry a portable charger and the necessary chargers for your electronics as you may need them during your trip.</li>
							<li><b>Travel adapter</b> -  The electrical sockets in Jaipur use type C and type D plugs, so if you are traveling from a country that uses a different type of plug, you will need a travel adapter.</li>
							<li><b>Backpack or daypack</b> - A small backpack or daypack can be useful for carrying essential items like water, snacks, and a camera while exploring the city.</li>
							<li><b>Money and documents</b> - Make sure to carry enough cash or a credit/debit card, and keep your important documents like passport, visa, and ID card safe.</li>
