## ABOUT 
The dataset you have described is likely to contain information about the number of tourists visiting India from different countries in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020.

The dataset may contain several columns, including the following:

Country: This column would contain the names of the countries that the tourists are coming from.

Year: This column would contain the year in which the data was collected, which would be 2018, 2019, or 2020.

Number of tourists: This column would contain the actual number of tourists that visited India from each country in each year.

The dataset would be useful in analyzing the trend of tourism in India over the past few years and identifying the countries that are sending the most tourists to India. It can also be used to study the impact of major events or policies on tourism, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in visa regulations, or marketing campaigns targeted at specific countries.

Overall, this dataset can provide valuable insights into the tourism industry in India and can be used by tourism authorities, researchers, and businesses to make data-driven decisions.
